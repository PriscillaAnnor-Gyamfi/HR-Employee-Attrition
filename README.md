<h1>HR Employee Attrition</h1>



<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
How can the attrition rate at Lenovo be reduced by 10% within the next 12 months?


<h2>Background</h2>

Lenovo grapples with a notable attrition rate of 16% among its 4,411 employees annually. This turnover poses challenges such as project delays, tarnished reputation with clients and partners, and the need for sustained efforts in recruitment and training.


<h2>Objectives</h2>

 - <b>Identify the employee categories outlined in the data provided with their respective attrition rates.</b>
 - <b>Investigate correlations between specific employee categories and their impact on attrition rates.</b>
 - <b>Conduct regression analysis to understand the relationship between various variables and their influence on attrition rates.</b>
 - <b>Provide recommendations based on analysis to mitigate annual attrition rates and foster employee retention.</b>




<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>Male employees, those aged between 18-30, and single individuals exhibit the highest attrition rates within the company.</b>
- <b>Employees with backgrounds in Human Resources and college education demonstrate elevated attrition rates.</b>
- <b>The Research Director role shows the highest attrition rate among job positions, indicating potential areas for targeted retention efforts.</b>
- <b>Attrition tends to occur most frequently within the first four years of employment and during the initial five years under the current manager, with delays in promotions contributing to an 18% increase in 
     attrition within the 6-10 year category.</b>
- <b>Survey results assessing employee job involvement, satisfaction, and environmental factors provide insights into the underlying causes of the company's high attrition rates.</b>
- <b>Poor work-life balance, particularly among employees residing far from the workplace or those frequently traveling for business, correlates with higher attrition rates.</b>
- <b>Frequent business travel, particularly among Research Directors and Healthcare Representatives, is associated with higher attrition rates, reaching 33%.</b>
- <b>Lower monthly incomes, prevalent among employees in the Human Resources department and those aged 51-60, contribute to elevated attrition rates.</b>
- <b>Inadequate training on job roles and skills leads to increased attrition rates, highlighting the importance of investing in employee development programs.</b>
- <b>Despite receiving significant salary hikes, employees still leave, indicating that additional factors beyond financial compensation influence attrition.</b>
- <b>Employees aged 18-30, typically within their initial 0-4 years at the company, exhibit high attrition rates regardless of the number of training opportunities provided.</b>
- <b>Age, total working years, years at the company, and years with the current manager show weak negative correlations with attrition, suggesting potential areas for further investigation.</b>
- <b>Variables with P-values < 0.05 in regression analysis, highlighted in yellow, are statistically significant and reliable for predicting attrition trends.</b>




<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- <b>Targeted Retention Strategies: Develop retention initiatives specifically tailored to address the needs and concerns of male employees, individuals aged between 18-30, and those who are single. Consider 
     implementing mentorship programs, career development opportunities, and flexible work arrangements to enhance job satisfaction and promote retention within these demographics.</b>
- <b>Enhanced Training Programs: Invest in comprehensive training programs aimed at equipping employees in the Human Resources field and those with college education backgrounds with the necessary skills and 
     knowledge to excel in their roles. Emphasize continuous learning and development to empower employees and reduce attrition rates.</b>
- <b>Departmental Support: Provide additional support and resources to the Human Resources department to address attrition challenges effectively. This may include streamlining recruitment processes, enhancing 
     employee engagement initiatives, and implementing strategies to improve workplace culture and morale within the department.</b>
- <b>Retention Incentives: Introduce retention incentives for employees in critical roles such as Research Directors, offering competitive compensation packages, career advancement opportunities, and recognition 
     programs to increase job satisfaction and reduce turnover.</b>
- <b>Work-Life Balance Initiatives: Implement initiatives to improve work-life balance, particularly for employees facing challenges related to commuting distance or frequent business travel. Explore flexible 
     scheduling options, remote work arrangements, and wellness programs to support employees' holistic well-being and reduce attrition rates.<b>
- <b>Ongoing Feedback and Communication: Foster a culture of open communication and feedback to address employee concerns proactively. Encourage regular discussions between managers and their teams to identify 
     areas for improvement and implement necessary changes to enhance job satisfaction and retention.</b>
- <b>Long-Term Career Planning: Provide employees with clear pathways for career progression and development, including opportunities for skill enhancement and advancement within the organization. Support 
     employees in setting and achieving long-term career goals to increase engagement and commitment to the company.<b>
- <b>Data-Driven Decision Making: Continuously monitor and analyze attrition trends and employee feedback to identify emerging issues and opportunities for improvement. Utilize data-driven insights to inform 
     decision-making processes and tailor retention strategies to address specific challenges within the organization.<b>
