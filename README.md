<h1>HR Employee Attrition</h1>



<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
How can the attrition rate at Lenovo be reduced by 10% within the next 12 months?


<h2>Background</h2>

Lenovo grapples with a notable attrition rate of 16% among its 4,411 employees annually. This turnover poses challenges such as project delays, tarnished reputation with clients and partners, and the need for sustained efforts in recruitment and training.


<h2>Objectives</h2>

 - <b>Identify the employee categories outlined in the data provided with their respective attrition rates.</b>
 - <b>Investigate correlations between specific employee categories and their impact on attrition rates.</b>
 - <b>Conduct regression analysis to understand the relationship between various variables and their influence on attrition rates.</b>
 - <b>Provide recommendations based on analysis to mitigate annual attrition rates and foster employee retention.</b>




<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>Male employees, those aged between 18-30, and single individuals exhibit the highest attrition rates within the company.</b>
- <b>Employees with backgrounds in Human Resources and college education demonstrate elevated attrition rates.</b>
- <b>The Research Director role shows the highest attrition rate among job positions, indicating potential areas for targeted retention efforts.</b>
- <b>Attrition tends to occur most frequently within the first four years of employment and during the initial five years under the current manager, with delays in promotions contributing to an 18% increase in 
     attrition within the 6-10 year category.</b>
- <b>Survey results assessing employee job involvement, satisfaction, and environmental factors provide insights into the underlying causes of the company's high attrition rates.</b>
- <b>Poor work-life balance, particularly among employees residing far from the workplace or those frequently traveling for business, correlates with higher attrition rates.</b>
- <b>Frequent business travel, particularly among Research Directors and Healthcare Representatives, is associated with higher attrition rates, reaching 33%.</b>
- <b>Lower monthly incomes, prevalent among employees in the Human Resources department and those aged 51-60, contribute to elevated attrition rates.</b>
- <b>Inadequate training on job roles and skills leads to increased attrition rates, highlighting the importance of investing in employee development programs.</b>
- <b>Despite receiving significant salary hikes, employees still leave, indicating that additional factors beyond financial compensation influence attrition.</b>
- <b>Employees aged 18-30, typically within their initial 0-4 years at the company, exhibit high attrition rates regardless of the number of training opportunities provided.</b>
- <b>Age, total working years, years at the company, and years with the current manager show weak negative correlations with attrition, suggesting potential areas for further investigation.</b>
- <b>Variables with P-values < 0.05 in regression analysis, highlighted in yellow, are statistically significant and reliable for predicting attrition trends.</b>




<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- <b>Cancellation Management Strategies: Implement measures to mitigate cancellations, particularly for City hotels, such as introducing flexible cancellation policies or requiring deposits for bookings to 
     ensure commitment from guests.</b>
- <b>Seasonal Pricing Strategy: Capitalize on peak booking periods in August, July, and May by implementing dynamic pricing strategies to maximize revenue during high-demand seasons.</b>
- <b>Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Leverage demographic preferences to tailor marketing efforts towards European countries, focusing on promotions and offers that appeal to guests from Portugal, Great Britain, 
     France, Spain, and Germany.</b>
- <b>Enhanced Online Presence: Strengthen partnerships with Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) to further penetrate the online booking market segment, optimizing visibility and accessibility for potential guests.</b>
- <b>Customer Loyalty Programs: Develop initiatives to increase customer retention, such as loyalty programs or personalized offers for repeated guests, to foster long-term relationships and encourage repeat 
     bookings.</b>
- <b>Review Pricing Strategy: Evaluate the Average Daily Rate (ADR) and pricing structure to ensure competitiveness within the market while maintaining profitability, considering factors such as demand trends 
     and guest preferences.</b>
- <b>Optimization of Room Allocation: Allocate resources and prioritize inventory management strategies to accommodate fluctuations in demand during peak booking periods, ensuring efficient utilization of hotel 
     facilities and maximizing revenue potential.<b>
